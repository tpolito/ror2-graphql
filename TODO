Project: 
✔ Add item images to the database @created(20-02-29 00:18) @done(20-02-29 17:24)
☐ Add data @created(20-02-29 00:18)
  ☐ Survivor Data @created(20-02-29 00:18)
  Do not have the data, will have to manually add it.
  ☐ Equipment Data @created(20-02-29 00:18)
  I have this data, just do not have it added to the API yet.
  ☐ When connecting to the MongoDB Atlas I cannot read any of the info in the items collection. @created(20-04-18 17:44)
  Unsure why this is, I'm pretty sure I'm connecting. But for some reason cannot read data from the collection.

Misc: 
  ✔ Upload CSV item data to MongoDB Atlas @created(20-04-17 23:44) @done(20-04-18 21:28)
